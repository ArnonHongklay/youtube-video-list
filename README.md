API Access, File I/O and Serialization

Demonstrate a simple YouTube video listing from the “ThailandStartUp” channel ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy_85vQ6tUvYvNR_B2htuTw ) by using the Youtube data API . Retrieve the data, display it as a simple list (this does not have to be a formatted or visually complete list) as well as persist the listing to disk.

Submission guidelines : The application can be built in any language or framework of your choice. You can optionally create the application with, or without, a graphical interface (i.e. a console application can be submitted). The solution should be submitted with all source code, build scripts, tests, and a README.txt file with instructions on how to run the application (including any required dependencies).

If submitting candidates are invited to participate in the interview stage of the recruitment process at Cerrita, a discussion of this application will form part of the interview.

How to run this:

```
git clone git@github.com:arnonhongklay/youtube-video-list.git
cd youtube-video-list
yarn install 
yarn start
```
